Guido Noto La Diega,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it,Contracting for the ‘Internet of Things’: Looking into the Nest,The world of the ‘Internet of Things’(‘IoT’) is just one manifestation of recent developments in information and communication technologies (‘ICTs’) closely tied to others including ‘cloud computing’and ‘big data’. For our purposes the ‘Thing’in the IoT is any physical entity capable of connectivity that directly interfaces the physical world such as embedded devices sensors and actuators. In considering IoT contracts this paper adopts a case study approach examining the complexity of IoT through the lens of a specific product: the Nest connected thermostat part of the Nest Labs business and owned by Google. We focus on the ‘legals’ of Nest (contractual documents licences etc.) to provide a case study of IoT complexity. After touching on some general contract law issues in relation to the IoT supply chain we examine the rights and obligations represented in these legals and discuss the extent to which collectively they present a coherent and comprehensible private law framework. We then consider the extent to which certain statutory regimes may treat IoT contracts in terms of addressing two characteristic contractual concerns: liability attribution and unfair terms. Our main conclusion is that the world of IoT demonstrates a need to consider recasting the concept of product to reflect the frequent inextricable mixture of hardware software data and service.,Intellectual Property/Privacy Law/IoT/AI/blockchain,128,University of Stirling,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it

An empirical study on online platforms and dehumanised negotiations,This article sheds light on the main consumer law aspects of the sharing economy through an empirical analysis of online platforms. Given the recent European consultation with the purpose of understanding (whether or more likely) how to regulate platforms it is critical that consumer law considerations will be part of future regulations. For instance it is hardly acceptable that the consumer acts in the belief that the contractual party (thus the potentially liable party) is the platform but in reality the former disclaims any responsibility and claims to be a mere intermediary which only seldom actually is. After a critical analysis of the Italian legislative proposal on platforms and collaborative economy the articles moves on to illustrate the use case of Uber the $60 billion ride-hailing platform which is acting at the margin of existing laws thus giving rise to protests and debate around the world. After an assessment of the Italian ruling preventing Uber to provide the UberPop service in Italy the use case is the perfect tool to show the main reasons for concern of consumers is the lack of awareness of their rights and obligations. This articles deals with two factors of the said lack: the contractual quagmire and the corporate labyrinth. In the conclusions it is presented an ambitious albeit feasible practical proposal. It is suggested the development of a mobile app that helps the consumers to assess the legal quality of the contracts they are entering in order to access the services offered through the platform. At the same time this app called ‘Awareness by Design’ should contribute to raise awareness in consumers thus creating critical mass and making …,Intellectual Property/Privacy Law/IoT/AI/blockchain,128,University of Stirling,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it
Guido Noto La Diega,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it,Clouds of Things: Data Protection and Consumer Law at the Intersection of Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things in the United Kingdom,The article critically analyses the Internet of Things (IoT) and its intersection with cloud computing the so-called Clouds of Things (CoT).‘Things’ are understood as any physical entity capable of connectivity that has a direct interface to the physical world (ie a sensing and/or actuating capability). From another perspective (especially product liability) Things can be seen as an inextricable mixture of hardware software and services. Alongside a clarification of the essentials the six factors of the CoT complexity are described and light is shed on the regulatory options (regulation co-regulation self-regulation holistic approach fragmentation). Focussing on the British legal systems the article reports on the state of the art of CoT deployment in the United Kingdom and deals with some of the main technical and legal issues emerging from CoT. Particularly the core will be data protection privacy and consumer law. Indeed these themes are considered the most relevant by the regulators. By mastering the relevant legal issues and following the example of the United Kingdom the Republic of Korea will be able to unleash its extraordinary potential as to the IoT thus retaining its position as the smartest country in the world.,Intellectual Property/Privacy Law/IoT/AI/blockchain,128,University of Stirling,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it

An empirical study on social norms and power imbalance in the fashion industry,It does not seem controversial that intellectual property law is not fit for the fashion industry. 1 From this consideration the call on lawmakers to amend existing laws2 or current jurisprudential approaches3 usually follows in order to ensure creativity be rewarded. Conversely some argue that there is no need for reforms because fashion is regulated by social norms 4 and the industry ‘benefits from widespread copying’. 5 There is a resurgence of studies showing how innovation thrives without the need for legal monopolies. 6 Researchers 7 however recently have shown how the regulation of creativity by social norms is not necessarily only a positive fact. In the same vein this author has been carrying out empirical qualitative research to map social norms and how these are interwoven with power imbalance throughout the fashion’s supply chain.

The occasion of this study is the adoption in 2016 of the final version of the Indian guidelines on the examination of computer-related inventions which have been surprisingly overlooked in the legal literature. The main idea is that the Internet of Things will lead to a dramatic increase of applications for software patents and if examiners courts and legislators are not careful there is a concrete risk of a surreptitious generalised grant of patents for computer programs as such (in Europe) and for abstract ideas without inventive concept (in the US). The clarity provided by the Indian guidelines following a lively public debate can constitute good practice that Europe and the US should take into account. Conversely the sea of patent software looks very stormy in the US where after some reversals of the leading case Alice Corp v CLS Bank International there seems to be the risk of swelling the ranks of speculative schemers who make it their business to watch the advancing wave of improvement and gather its foam in the form of patented monopolies. Some good news however comes from a dissenting opinion that innovatively suggests bringing free speech into the reasoning on patents.,Intellectual Property/Privacy Law/IoT/AI/blockchain,128,University of Stirling,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it

Of Drones Robots and the Info-Capitalist Society,Italy has been one of the first countries in the world to enact ad hoc regulations on drones. Therefore the Italian approach may constitute a model for many regulations to come; nonetheless the legal literature seems to overlook the phenomenon. In this article I place the discourse on drones in the context of some more general considerations on the main legal issues related to the deployment of machines including robots in our everyday life. Indeed most considerations apply equally to robots and drones moving from the unrefined albeit practical observation that the latter are robots equipped with wings.

Guido Noto La Diega,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it,Can Permissionless Blockchains be Regulated and Resolve Some of the Problems of Copyright Law?,In October 2018 the European Parliament passed a resolution on distributed ledger technologies that recognised blockchains’ potential to disrupt copyright and creative industries. The aim of this chapter is to examine blockchain technologies and provide an assessment of their disruptive potential upon the legal sphere of intellectual property and in particular copyright in the music industry. In order to do so this chapter will start off by clarifying that the blockchain does not exist because there are several different types of blockchains and accordingly different legal and regulatory issues are involved. After identifying the type of permissionless blockchain that is analysed in this chapter–that is permissionless Turing complete open distributed peer-to-peer transparent tamper resistant and censorship resistant– we move on to identify the definitional and non-definitional features of blockchain technologies. For the blockchain to unleash its disruptive potential it must be clarified whether it complies with existing laws and whether new regulations are needed. Should existing regulations be found insufficient only then a serious discussion around new regulations could be started and this should take into account the necessity not to stifle innovation the level of development of the relevant technologies the importance of involving all the stakeholders and to place the discussion at a supra-national level. The focus of the chapter is to critically assess whether public permissionless blockchains can be used to disrupt intellectual property law by resolving some of the problems in copyright law with particular regard to the issues of copyright registration …,Intellectual Property/Privacy Law/IoT/AI/blockchain,128,University of Stirling,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it
Guido Noto La Diega,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it,Internet of Things and Patents: Towards the IoT Patent Wars?,Intellectual property is a key albeit overlooked issue when it comes to the Internet of Things (IoT). It is still unclear for instance to what extent trade secrets can be used to prevent the user from controlling their own device (the so-called right to hack) and to hinder interoperability. Likewise it is still to be fully explored to what extent intellectual property (database rights) can be used to prevent data portability. This paper focuses on patent law and namely on computer-implemented inventions by giving account of the approaches followed in Europe United States and India. With the IoT patenting activity being over eight times larger than the general worldwide increase in patenting research on this field appears critical. The occasion of this study is the adoption in 2016 of the final version of the Indian guidelines on the examination of computer-related inventions which have been surprisingly overlooked in the legal literature. The main idea is that the Internet of Things will lead to a dramatic increase of applications for software patents and if examiners courts and legislators will not be careful there is the concrete risk of a surreptitious generalised grant of patents for computer programs as such (in Europe) and for abstract ideas (in the United States). The clarity provided by the Indian guidelines following a lively public debate can constitute good practices that Europe the United States as well as the Republic of Turkey should take into account.

Guido Noto La Diega,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it,UBERTRUST: How Uber Represents Itself to Its Customers Through its Legal and Non-Legal Documents,This paper examines some of the key factors that contribute to build or erode users’ trust in a platform-based service such as the one provided by Uber Technologies Inc. As clarified by the European Commission the future Internet cannot succeed without trust of online platforms’ users. The paper explores Uber’s web of relationships with different categories of users i.e. ‘driver-partners’ ‘riders’ ‘developers’ and ‘business users’ through Uber’s legal and non-legal representations. By analysing Uber ‘legals’ (terms of service privacy policy etc.) and the non-legal representations of these norms through the wider Uber community ecosystem (forums blogs etc.) it explores how transparency and collective awareness can play a role in sustaining trust. It concludes that the opacity of its ‘legals’ and of its corporate structure could create tensions within the market and undermine the users’ trust. Therefore the authors recommend that in order to foster trust and ensure fairness Uber should ensure consistency between its legal and non-legal representation and adopt a more transparent and fair approach in its legals. This would in turn empower its users community to participate in the decision making and could provide an example for other platforms.,Intellectual Property/Privacy Law/IoT/AI/blockchain,128,University of Stirling,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it
Guido Noto La Diega,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it,Can the law fix the problems of fashion? An empirical study on social norms and imbalance of power in the fashion industry,The fashion industry is affected by an imbalance of power that goes beyond the outsourcing of part of the manufacture to developing countries. Said imbalance characterises the whole supply chain and hinders freedom of expression freedom to conduct business and hence creativity and innovation. In order to understand fashion IP lawyers and lawmakers need to take into account that the law is not the main device the regulating the relevant relationships. Indeed fashion is a closed community a family where complaining is rather frowned upon and where contracts do not reflect the actual relationships between the parties. In order to rebalance power this article explores the possibility to treat good faith and inequality of bargaining power as unifying principles of contract law. However in light of the evidence collected during a number of in-depth interviews with fashion stakeholders it seems clear that social norms are the main source of regulation of relationships and therefore intervening at the level of the contracts may not be helpful. Competition law in turn may be of more help in rebalancing power; however cases such as Coty v Parfümerie Akzente do not augur well. Moreover competition law is useful when the relationship is over but it is in all the stakeholders’ interest to keep the relationship alive while fixing its imbalance. This study confirms recent findings that social norms do not only have a positive impact on fields with low IP-equilibrium and it sheds light on the broader consequences of the reliance on social norms and on its relationship to power imbalance. This work makes a twofold recommendation.

Guido Noto La Diega,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it,The Artificial Conscience of Lethal Autonomous Weapons: Marketing Ruse or Reality?,There are two interwoven trends in cyber-counterterrorism. On the one hand countries such as Israel and Russia announce the deployment of lethal autonomous weapons. Such weapons constitute the third revolution in warfare after gunpowder and nuclear arms. On the other hand researchers try and embed ethics into the design of these weapons (so-called artificial conscience or" ethics by design"). The contention of this paper is that artificial conscience is a mere marketing ruse aimed at making the deployment of lethal autonomous weapons and other autonomous robots acceptable in society. Whereas there are strong reasons to object to this trend some solutions to the pitfalls of ethics by design have been presented. However they do not seem viable in a military context. In particular the so-called customised-ethics approach is applicable only to commercial and civil machines. When deciding whether to kill 600 civilians in order to hit 14 al-Qaeda leaders which set of values should be implemented? This is a compelling argument for banning lethal autonomous weapons altogether.,Intellectual Property/Privacy Law/IoT/AI/blockchain,128,University of Stirling,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it
Guido Noto La Diega,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it,Grinding privacy in the Internet of Bodies. An empirical qualitative research on dating mobile applications for men who have sex with men,The'Internet of Bodies'(IoB) is the latest development of the Internet of Things. It encompasses a variety of phenomena from implanted smart devices to the informal regulation of body norms in online communities. This article presents the results of empirical qualitative research on dating mobile applications for men who have sex with men ('MSM apps'). The pair IoB-privacy is analysed through two interwoven perspectives: the intermediary liability of the MSM app providers and the responsibility for discriminatory practices against the users' physical appearance (aesthetic discrimination). On the one hand privacy constitutes the justification of the immunities from intermediary liability (so-called safe harbours). Indeed it is believed that if online intermediaries were requested to play an active role (eg by policing their platforms to prevent their users from carrying out illegal activities) this would infringe the users' privacy. This article calls into question this justification. On the other hand in an age of ubiquitous surveillance one may think that the body is the only place where the right to be left alone can be effective. This article contests this view by showing that the users' bodies are no longer the sanctuary of privacy. Bodies are observed measured and sometimes change as a result of the online experience. This research adopted an empirical qualitative multi-layered methodology which included a focus group structured interviews an online survey and the text analysis of the Terms of Service privacy policies and guidelines of a number of MSM apps.,Intellectual Property/Privacy Law/IoT/AI/blockchain,128,University of Stirling,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it

The case of targeted advertising,Facilitated by the growth of cloud computing artificial intelligence (e.g. machine learning) and big data (e.g. predictive analytics) new tracking and profiling techniques have been developed. They have enabled the rise of targeted advertising that is the provision of advertisements tailored to the tastes and habits of the user who actually views them. If targeted advertising is effective data protection laws still apply. Most regulations look at the phenomenon from the data protection perspective whilst in this paper it is argued that a holistic approach should be sought. Indeed intellectual property competition law and consumer protection come necessarily into play. A general idea in this paper is that one should treat the data as digital assets in the users’ IP portfolio thus leading the users to care more about the way their data are processed shared and sold.

The yet-to-be-transposed Trade Marks Directive introduces a new definition of trade marks where the graphic representation of the mark is no longer required. Under the new regime those who want to register a smell will only need to represent it ‘in a manner which enables the competent authorities and the public to determine the clear and precise subject matter of the protection afforded to its proprietor’(art 3 (b)). Some difficulties may remain because the Trade Marks Directive incorporated the so-called Sieckmann criteria that the (then graphical) representation must be ‘clear precise self-contained easily accessible intelligible durable and objective’(recital 13). However even not going as far as arguing that ‘the amendments will abolish the Sieckmann judgement’(Sahin 2016 513) it is not excluded that the seven criteria may be interpreted differently in the future for example as meaning that a combination of description chemical formula and sample may meet the new requirements for registration. Indeed with the new definition of trade marks there is a shift from the ‘how’to the ‘who’. It is immaterial how the trade mark is represented (whether graphically or otherwise) as long as the competent authorities and the public can determine the subject matter of the protection. Arguably the said combination of description chemical formula and sample may suffice from the authorities’ perspective. When it comes to the public it is likely that this requirement will be absorbed by the distinctiveness.

Guido Noto La Diega,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it,Some Considerations on Intelligent Online Behavioural Advertising,The Cambridge Analytica scandal in March 2018 was a useful reminder of how personal data is used for targeting users and of how such targeting has profound societal consequences. Online behavioural advertising refers to advertisements which are tailored to the tastes and habits of the user who actually views them. It is an intricate phenomenon for a number of reasons including a twofold regulatory interweave. Firstly between top-down and self-regulation. Secondly between the personal data perspective and the competition one. This paper aims to get the knots out in the belief that rising awareness about the issues in online behavioural advertising is pivotal to a fair online environment. The paper is particularly timely in light of new regulations (draft ePrivacy Regulation and General Data Protection Regulation) worrying industry moves (eg the Facebook/WhatsApp data synchronisation) and the advent of new technologies. In particular it will be shown that artificial intelligence presents not only threats to consumers but also opportunities for bespoke compliance mechanisms.

Guido Noto La Diega,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it,The European strategy on robotics and artificial intelligence: too much ethics too little security,There is an increasing interest in the ethical design of robots. As evidence of this fact one may refer to some recent reports and the European Parliament’s resolution on civil law rules on robotics. The latter will be the primary focus of this analysis since the EU Parliament is the first legal institution in the world to have initiated work of a law on robots and artificial intelligence. The European strategy on robotics seems affected by two main problems: an excessive emphasis on ethics at the expense of security and more generally a lack of awareness of the critical role played by the operation of striking a balance between competing interests. Balancing is pivotal to the interpretation and application of the law. And the current development of AI technologies does not enable the delegation of the operation to robots. Certainly the most controversial point regards the status of robots as electronic persons. Even though the suggestion may seem extreme it may prove to be successful for at least three reasons. First robots are becoming more and more similar to humans (anthropomorfisation and AI). Second humans are becoming increasingly akin to robots (artificial enhancement). Third the robot’s legal personality would be profitable for the robotic industry.,Intellectual Property/Privacy Law/IoT/AI/blockchain,128,University of Stirling,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it

Non-conventional paths to counter data appropriation and empower consumers,The Internet of Things (IoT) has heralded a never-before-seen quantity of high-quality data. This includes both personal and non-personal data. Factual and legal control over IoT data gives companies unparalleled power to influence consumers policy makers and the other stake-holders of the IoT’s supply chain. The combination of analytics algorithms the data goldmine structure and the output of data processes are regularly kept secret by businesses. Leveraging this portfolio of big data and trade secrets IoT companies put in place practices that can negatively affect consumers who are often unaware of them due to technical and legal secrecy.‘Technical’secrecy results from the opacity of the algorithms that underpin the IoT especially when AI-en-abled.‘Legal’secrecy in turn come from a combination of trade secrets and strategic contract management that keep IoT data practices secret. This begs the central research question of this article: how can consumers be empowered to counter IoT data appropriation?,Intellectual Property/Privacy Law/IoT/AI/blockchain,128,University of Stirling,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it

Guido Noto La Diega,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it,The European approach to recognising downgrading and erasing same-sex marriages celebrated abroad,This chapter analyses how European countries that provide some protection for same-sex couples (eg civil partnerships but not marriage) deal with same-sex marriages celebrated abroad. In this respect there are three models: recognition downgrading and erasure. Recognition means that these marriages are recognised as marriages either for all purposes or for some of them eg for the exercise of EU freedoms. Romania is the case study because Coman–the CJEU case that provides a basis for the recognition model–concerned a Romanian case and therefore it is important to see how Member States implement the CJEU’s ruling.‘Downgrading’is the model whereby foreign marriages are treated as national civil partnerships. This is based on Orlandi and therefore Italy is the chosen case study. Hungary finally represents the ‘erasure’model whereby same-sex marriages celebrated abroad are not even recognised as civil partnerships. These models are criticised from an EU law European human rights law and private international law perspective.,Intellectual Property/Privacy Law/IoT/AI/blockchain,128,University of Stirling,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it

The aim of this chapter is to examine blockchain technologies and provide an assessment of their disruptive potential upon the legal sphere of intellectual property and in particular copyright in the music industry. In order to do so this chapter will start off by clarifying that the blockchain does not exist because there are several different types of blockchains and accordingly different legal and regulatory issues. After identifying the type of permissionless blockchain that is analysed in this chapter we move on to identify the definitional and non-definitional features of blockchain technologies. For the blockchain to unleash its disruptive potential it must be clarified whether it complies with existing laws and whether new regulations are needed. Should existing regulations be found insufficient only then could a serious discussion around new regulations be started and it should take into account the necessity not to stifle innovation the level of development of the relevant technologies the importance of involving all the stakeholders and the placement of the discussion at a supranational level. The focus of the chapter is to critically assess whether public permissionless blockchains can be used to disrupt intellectual property law by resolving some of the problems in copyright law with particular regard to the issues of copyright registration …,Intellectual Property/Privacy Law/IoT/AI/blockchain,128,University of Stirling,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it

Guido Noto La Diega,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it,Artificial Intelligence and databases in the age of big machine data,This paper deals with those databases where Artificial Intelligence technologies are used to obtain verify or present the database’s contents (‘AI databases’). The overarching research question is whether AI databases can be protected under the copyright and sui generis regimes provided by the Database Directive. The alleged inadequacy of the sui generis right for the data economy and in particular for machine-generated data led the European Parliament to call on the Commission to abolish said right and the Commission to propose the introduction of a data producer’s right as a new property that would have done what the sui generis right had been unable to. It is this paper’s contention that contrary to popular belief the sui generis right is fit for AI databases and that a different solution would lead to an overprotection of said subject matter by contractual means. The sui generis right may be the best if not the only way to protect AI ‘authorial’works. Indeed even if AI works currently fall outside the scope of copyright law for lack of originality they could nonetheless be protected if part of a database. Thus thanks to AI the sui generis right may become more important than it ever was.,Intellectual Property/Privacy Law/IoT/AI/blockchain,128,University of Stirling,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it

An Intellectual Property Law Perspective,The WTO can play an important role in achieving the UN sustainable development goals. Investments in AI and IoT could go a long way in that these technologies could lead to economic growth innovation good health and new services. For this to happen however they must be adequately governed. This means practically that we need laws–and IP laws above all given their role in incentivising creativity and innovation–that are fit for AI and IoT. As shown above AI could lead to unprecedented research developments with revolutionary impact on healthcare. They would do so not only by changing the way we carry out research–with AI-powered data mining and cancer-predicting deep learning models–but also by making us rethink certain IP laws. The reference is to the patent system that has hitherto been abused by pharmaceutical companies that have developed strategies to retain perpetual and absolute monopolies on medical inventions thus preventing access to medicines especially in developing and least-developed countries. AI could change this. It could indeed change the standard currently applied to assess one of the key requirements for patentability ie inventive step. We currently assess if an invention presupposes an inventive step and is hence patentable from the point of view of the ‘person skilled in the art’ a notional worker who lacks ingenuity and has limited knowledge. With AI becoming commonplace and increasingly creative the new standard to be adopted may and should be the AI-enhanced researcher.

This isually takes the form of civil unions (e.g. Italy and Greece) or of no recognition (e.g. Poland and Lithuania). However other solutions are also possible. For instance some countries recognise only same-sex marriages celebrated abroad (e.g. Armenia and Estonia).  In Northern Ireland adoption has been available to same-sex couples since 2013 even though the Northern Ireland Assembly voted against same-sex marriage (Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission Re Judicial Review [2013] NICA 37).

For many years the regime of computer-implemented inventions has been unclear until the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trade Marks (the Indian homologous of the Intellectual Property Office) issued its Guidelines on the examination of computer-related inventions. Notably this gave rise the civil society’s protests; indeed there was the fear that the government was surreptisciously allowing the patentability of computer programmes per se. Therefore the guidelines have been withdrawn and recently a new version has been published. It openly reaffirms the exclusion of the software patents and introduces a three-step test to determine the applicability of sec. 3 (k) of the Patents Act to computer-related inventions. This opinion focuses the new guidance by placing it in the context of the leading role of India in the technological and social developments revolving around the Internet of Things.,Intellectual Property/Privacy Law/IoT/AI/blockchain,128,University of Stirling,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it

Intellectual property after the EU referendum,The Government is deciding how and when to trigger Article 50 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In the meantime some “remainers” are pointing out the allegedly tragic consequences of Brexit whereas a more cautious approach would be wise. There is much uncertainty on the future of intellectual property (IP) in the UK after the referendum and one could foresee that there will be more cons than pros. However some opportunities may as well arise. This poster aims to assess the impact of Brexit on IP by distinguishing between areas that do not need significant intervention areas where no real intervention will be allowed and areas where there is need for an update. In the near future the Government and the Parliament will be likely focused on the negotiations with the European Union and there is the risk that IP issues will be overlooked. Therefore it will be up to the judiciary to modernise intellectual property and ensure that the UK does not depart radically from the IP systems of the Member States. Thus by ensuring a substantial albeit not full harmonisation of the relevant rules fragmented IP regimes will not constitute trade barriers and the UK will retain its appeal as a thriving marketplace for investors. In order to do so some “IP regimes shopping” will be useful although this will mean a partial departure from the EU rules. A takeaway is that since English judges will not be entitled to preliminary references to the Court of Justice they will become eventually European judges.,Intellectual Property/Privacy Law/IoT/AI/blockchain,128,University of Stirling,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it

Guido Noto La Diega,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it,British Perspectives on the Internet of Things. The Clouds of Things-Health Use Case,In 1941 Herbert Marcuse predicted that ubiquitous technology would have changed the concept itself of rationality. This paper does not aim at measuring the impact on rationality of a ‘growing technical ensemble of things and relations’ but Marcuse’s idea helps us understand that the Internet of Things should make us rethink some fundamental principles. Therefore it is crucial to study this (relatively) new phenomenon with a multidisciplinary pragmatic approach that moving from a relatively complex use case touches some of the main technical and legal issues emerging from it and from the Clouds of Things the intersection of the Internet of Things and cloud computing. After a clarification of the concepts of Internet of Things and Clouds of Things and having shed light on the complexity of the relevant ecosystem (especially as regards the actors involved) the author proposes a taxonomy of eHealth and finally narrow down to the CoT-Health use case. In particular the focus of this paper is twofold. On the one hand it explores some legal aspects–mainly data-protection related–of mobile health (mHealth) a field without clear regulations and it usually is not even considered as part of eHealth. Alongside it narrows down to a CoT-health scenario centred on the so-called repurposing. With regards to the latter some considerations about liability are presented. The decentralisation of healthcare big data and the patient’s empowerment made possible by CoT-Health appear as the best strategy to face the challenges of healthcare in the 21st century.,Intellectual Property/Privacy Law/IoT/AI/blockchain,128,University of Stirling,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=B3U7yvcAAAAJ&hl=it

The use of intellectual property rights and contracts combined with technological protection measures can hinder TDM and the deployment of SDSs. Further those legal constraints can negatively impact on artificial intelligence innovation because that requires improved access to data. There are thus various arguments for enhanced “machine legibility”.

Health information technologies open up new legal issues in the transition from a paper-based framework to a digital one. The paper focus on a specific issue emerging in this transition the treatment of the so-called «supersensitive data» of minors processed within the legal framework of the «Fascicolo Sanitario Elettronico»(FSE) a patient-centred ehealth system that has been recently defined and regulated in Italian law. After having outlined the general discipline of this system the paper shows how the right to control their information (in some cases even against the parents’ right to access these information) recognized to minors by a growing body of sources of law and case law interpretations is challenged in this new scenario and need to be taken in account when designing the rules and the information flows permitted by FSE systems.

The goal of this paper is to identify the most pressing obstacles (in terms of funding technology Intellectual Property Rights contracts data protection and social norms) which are hindering the development of Open Science and Open Research Data with particular attention to the situation of developing countries. The innovative aim of this paper which is the first essay of a broader research is to prepare the epistemological basis for a Law and Technology theory of “Open Bioinformation”(OB) where bioinformation stands for research data in life sciences. We argue that so far the literature has addressed the promotion of openness in science and research data only in a sectorial manner taking into account just one or a few of the factors affecting openness as if they were not related or mutually influenced. Therefore the suggested solutions are limited to a single perspective and fail to consider the dynamics of information control. In our view a holistic approach that tries to zoom out from the specific disciplines and take into account the whole picture would contribute to determining an effective policy for promoting OB.

The latter are becoming increasingly important (one of the ten ideas changing the world according to Time magazine) since they allow to collect store and distribute in a secure and professional way a critical mass of human biological samples for research purposes. Tissues and related data are fundamental for the development of the biomedical research and the emerging field of translational medicine: they represent the “raw material” for every kind of biomedical study. For this reason it is crucial to understand the boundaries of Intellectual Property (IP) in this prickly context. In fact both data sharing and collaborative research have become an imperative in contemporary open science whose development depends inextricably on: the opportunities to access and use data the possibility of sharing practices between communities the cross-checking of information and results and chiefly interactions with experts in different fields of knowledge. Data sharing allows both to spread the costs of analytical results that researchers cannot achieve working individually and if properly managed to avoid the duplication of research. These advantages are crucial: access to a common pool of pre-competitive data and the possibility to endorse follow-on research projects are fundamental for the progress of biomedicine.

OA’s main function is to be found somewhere else namely in the ability to subvert the power to control science’s governance and its future directions (Open Science) a power that is more often found within the academic institutions rather than outside. By decentralizing and opening-up not just the way in which scholarship is published but also the way in which it is assessed OA removes the barriers that helped turn science into an intellectual oligopoly even before an economic one. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that Open Access is a key enabler of Open Science which in turn will lead to a more Open Society. Furthermore the paper argues that while legislative interventions play an important role in the top-down regulation of Open Access legislators currently lack an informed and systematic vision on the role of Open Access in science and society. In this historical phase other complementary forms of intervention (bottom-up) appear much more “informed” and effective.

Il progetto che ha visto la partecipazione di un team interdisciplinare coordinato dal Prof. Paolo Bosetti del Dipartimento di Ingegneria Industriale si propone l’obiettivo innovativo di costruire un esacottero con MTOM compreso tra i 2 ei 25 Kg con un sistema per la navigazione autonoma che possa affiancarsi alle operazioni di soccorso in caso di valanga: il drone infatti sarebbe dotato di un ricevitore ARTVA (Apparecchio di Ricerca dei Travolti in VAlanga) che unito a sistemi per la mappatura localizzazione e navigazione sarebbe in grado di restringere il perimetro della ricerca ed individuare il segnale proveniente dall’apparecchio della vittima così agevolando l’intervento delle squadre di soccorso e delle unità cinofile. La tecnologia risulterebbe dunque di supporto in un contesto particolarmente complesso nel quale il tempo costituisce un fattore cruciale: la probabilità di estrarre vivo un soggetto travolto da una valanga crolla vertiginosamente dal 92% dei primi 15 minuti fino ad arrivare al 30% trascorsi 35 minuti dall’evento.

After having outlined the general discipline of this system the paper shows how the right to control their information (in some cases even against the parents’ right to access these information) recognized to minors by a growing body of sources of law and case law interpretations is challenged in this new scenario and need to be taken in account when designing the rules and the information flows permitted by FSE systems. In conclusion some recommendations to ensure the proper design and implementation of a FSE system according to the minors’ right to control their information are provided.,legal design/privacy and data protection/intellectual property/biobank and ehealth law/platform economy,92,Postdoc Research Fellow /  UCLouvain and Université Saint-Louis - Bruxelles,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=JnkeH28AAAAJ&hl=it

Attraverso la rappresentazione del momento processuale o la narrazione di vicende dalla rilevanza giuridica le trame narrative mettono in luce le incongruenze del sistema-giustizia portando l’operatore del diritto ad interrogarsi su dilemmi etico-deontologici e sul suo stesso ruolo all’interno della società civile. Un operatore che raramente è considerato nella vicenda narrativa come un protagonista o un personaggio positivo: è semmai l’antitesi del kalos kai agathos. La letteratura ci restituisce infatti una rappresentazione del diritto e dei suoi professionisti tutt’altro che lusinghiera e la satira è stata uno dei generi maggiormente utilizzati in tal senso.,legal design/privacy and data protection/intellectual property/biobank and ehealth law/platform economy,92,Postdoc Research Fellow /  UCLouvain and Université Saint-Louis - Bruxelles,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=JnkeH28AAAAJ&hl=it

Le sue componenti rappresentano infatti una straordinaria fonte di informazioni rilevante dal punto di vista scientifico e di riflesso anche economico. Eppure le speranze della scienza e delle medicina personalizzata non sono unicamente riposte nel cosiddetto codice della vita. I progressi della ricerca biomedica raggiunti negli ultimi anni sono riconducibili sia agli sviluppi della biologia molecolare che ha permesso l’analisi massiccia dei dati genetici sia alla possibilità di disporre di una massa critica di campioni biologici raccolti annotati e conservati secondo standard di elevata qualità. Da qui la necessità di creare strumenti di lavoro e strutture come le biobanche capaci di collezionare in maniera sistematica organizzata e professionale materiale biologico di origine umana. Il termine biobanca conosce diverse declinazioni all’interno del panorama scientifico potendosi esse distinguere a seconda del tipo di materiale che conservano e dello scopo per cui sono state istituite. Di fronte a questo composito scenario la disciplina giuridica delle biobanche di ricerca appare altrettanto articolata. Manca ancora una definizione condivisa di biobanca e nel silenzio del legislatore prolificano le guidelines ed altri strumenti non vincolanti. Il ruolo dell’interprete in un simile frangente è pertanto quello di ricomporre le tessere di questo variegato mosaico applicando alla disciplina giuridica della biobanca quella regolamentazione contenuta in altri atti che può interessarla sotto alcuni profili.

In failing to provide equal access the South African government has failed to realise the theoretical justifications underpinning the law of copyright as well as its obligations on both a national (in terms of the constitution legislation and case law) and international level. It will then be asked what South Africa ought to do so as to better this situation by examining what the international community is doing in order to better establish an environment of equal access to literary works specifically in terms of the recent Marrakesh Treaty and what implications this may have for South Africa in its quest to better balance the interests of copyright users and owners in such a way that equal access is achieved.,intellectual property/public policy/public law/developing nations,2,Abertay University,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=uE1oO1gAAAAJ&hl=en

In doing so South Africa sought to replicate the apparent success of the United States of America’s Bayh-Dole legislation. One of the express objectives of the Bayh-Dole Act is the increase in university-industry collaborations. Whilst UI has not been expressly stated as a primary aim of the IPR Act the legislative history has demonstrated that issues relating to UI have permeated the political landscape from the inception of the IPR Act. It is therefore relevant-although hitherto unexplored-to consider whether South Africa’s IPR Act might have the same supposedly positive effect on UI experienced by the Bayh-Dole Act. In answering this question this paper chooses to focus on two factors which may be considered particularly pertinent in light of South Africa’s recent socio-legal landscape namely (a) the lack of substantive patent examinations and (b) government investment in higher education. To this end it will be argued that the IPR Act will only serve to have a negative effect on UI if any at all.,intellectual property/public policy/public law/developing nations,2,Abertay University,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=uE1oO1gAAAAJ&hl=en

This paper looks at what is considered to be good practice in the current higher education landscape broadly and then develops what it considers to be good practice for law schools specifically. This law-specific definition of good practice encompasses both active as well as reflective learning that can be facilitated by means of a blended classroom. Whilst traditional pedagogies remain prevalent in law schools generally this paper questions whether a teaching-intensive modern UK higher education institution like Abertay University is able to break the mould. To this end the paper explores to what extent this definition of good practice is reflected within Abertay University’s law school using as a case study the Public Law module of 2017/2018. It concludes by finding that contrary to popular belief there is much that ancient institutions can learn from modern establishments when it comes to the student experience.,intellectual property/public policy/public law/developing nations,2,Abertay University,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=uE1oO1gAAAAJ&hl=en

However what does need investigating is the potential copyright issue which undercurrents the trial particularly in regards to one of the state witnesses Dr Michelle Burger. Dr Burger works as a lecturer at the University of Pretoria. As such her staff photo was made available on the University’s website along with her colleagues’ photos. It is that staff photo which shall be the topic of this legal opinion. Many academic and non-fiction authors have their images displayed on the websites of their research institutions and so there is a need for clarity on what may and may not be done by third parties in regards to such images.Before testifying Dr Burger exercised her right to permit only an audio recording of her testimony be used for broadcasting purposes. In other words the media was barred from showing her image but not from recording and publishing her oral testimony. However local media house eNCA and newspaper Die Beeld ignored this limitation and respectively broadcasted and published the staff photograph of Dr Burger which they had sourced from the University’s website. In order to decide whether or not there is an action for copyright infringement to be had against eNCA and Die Beeld we shall have to ask whether or not the two media houses unlawfully in their use of Dr Burger’s photo. If as shall be argued here they did act unlawfully we shall then have to surmise who might be able to hold the two media houses accountable in terms of copyright law.,intellectual property/public policy/public law/developing nations,2,Abertay University,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=uE1oO1gAAAAJ&hl=en

Thus a State is bound by an obligation to prevent detrimental cyber conduct committed from its territory or transiting through its territory or any other area under its exclusive control when it knows or should have known of the conduct when the conduct contradicts the rights of another State and when it may cause or is causing serious harm. Where a State is aware or should have been aware of the misuse of its territorial cyber infrastructure the State must attempt to prevent or to react to the harmful transboundary operation applying all reasonable measures.

The “unwilling or unable” test is not part of contemporary international law. Indeed State practice remains unclear as to the requirements for the implementation of this test when it is applied to a State from which a non-State actor commits armed attacks in the absence of any positive support of that State.

It outlines the arguments presented by some States in favour of a right to self-defence against the IS as a non-State actor. It also explains that in contradiction with the traditional temporal understanding of the right to self-defence some of the States intervening in Syria assert a right to react to imminent armed attacks or even to a simple threat of armed attacks committed by the IS. This article shows that there is limited international acceptance of a broad right to self-defence as a justification for the military involvement in Syria. It concludes that neither a right to self-defence against a non-State actor nor a right to self-defence in reaction to potential future attacks has crystallised in customary international law.

Overall enforcement can take two forms: direct enforcement when the content of the decision not implemented by the addressee is implemented by another actor; or indirect enforcement when coercive measures are taken against the non-complying actor in order to compel compliance. The study first outlines how binding Security Council measures are enforced before analysing the enforcement of ICJ judgments. It then examines the enforcement of Security Council resolutions and of ICJ judgments arguing that such enforcement is mostly political influenced by State sensitivities and thus unreliable.

Irene Couzigou, PhD, LLM,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vNvRYksAAAAJ&hl=en,The use of force as a response to cyberterrorism,Cyber technology is likely to become an essential terrorist tool. Indeed the development of cyberspace enables terrorist actors to increase their offensive capabilities significantly. Furthermore cyberattacks can be carried out more easily and with a lower risk of detection than attacks with conventional weapons: it is enough to have a computer and a connection to the Internet. It is important then that general definitions of terrorism can be applied to cyberterrorism. Article 2 of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism understands a terrorist act as:[a] ny other act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian or to any other person not taking an active part in hostilities in a situation of armed conflict when the purpose of such an act by its nature or context is to intimidate a population or to compel a Government or an international Organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.(at www. un. org/law/cod/finterr. htm 1 July 2014)This definition is only for the purposes of the Convention. However since the convention is almost universal–186 state parties as of December 2014–it constitutes the nearest approach today to a comprehensive definition of terrorism agreed on by the international community.

The most famous of these is the ‘Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant’(ISIL) more commonly known as ‘Islamic State’(IS)(Flasch 2015: 3). Militants of IS now control wide portions of territory in Iraq and Syria as well as an area in Libya. IS has killed and injured thousands of people and IS-related violence has led to the displacement of over a million people. Atrocities committed by the IS have extended to several other countries in the Middle-East in West-Africa and in Europe (Zerrouky Audureau and Vaudano 2015).In response to attacks of IS Iraq has requested that the United States and its allies assist it in defending itself against the group. Since September 2014 Iraq together with the United States and several other states has been using force against IS in Syria without the consent of the Syrian regime. Iraq acts on the basis of its right to individual self-defence and the other intervening states intervene on the basis of the right to collective self-defence. Self-defence as well as the use of force within an authorisation given by the United Nations (UN) Security Council constitute the two exceptions to the international prohibition on the use of force between states (Articles 51 and 42 UN Charter). An action in self-defence can be individual when the victim state reacts to an armed attack or collective when other states react to an armed attack on the request of the victim state. France began its military intervention in Syria in September 2015 resorting to the rights to both individual and collective self-defence.

Irene Couzigou, PhD, LLM,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vNvRYksAAAAJ&hl=en,The Challenges Posed by Cyber Attacks to the Law on Self-Defence,States have become increasingly dependent on computers and the networks that connect them. The development of cyber space enables States and non-State actors to increase their offensive capabilities significantly. Cyber attacks can now be carried out more easily and with a lower risk of detection than attacks with conventional weapons. These attacks may produce effects that are not only internal to a computer or network but also external by causing harm to connected facilities which could in turn lead to serious physical harm to property or individuals. Such would be the case for example when a computer network attack disables an air traffic control system and causes an airliner to crash. This paper addresses a number of challenges posed by cyber attacks to the law of self-defence. Section II outlines the international criteria for the attribution of a cyber operation to a State. Section III argues that only cyber attacks reaching the level of an armed attack give the right to the victim State to use self-defence. Section IV explains that the law on self-defence does not offer an effective response to cyber attacks because as international law stands only cyber attacks attributed to States trigger the right to self-defence. Section V concludes that current international law on self-defence needs to be adapted to meet the challenges posed by cyber attacks.,General Public International Law/The law of International Peace and Security/International Cyber Security Law/International H,77,Senior Lecturer University of Aberdeen School of Law (UK),-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=vNvRYksAAAAJ&hl=en

Those do not control the use of the cyber infrastructure located on their territorial base or any other area under their exclusive control. This is true of poorly technologically developed States yet also of technologically developed States–whose political and legal culture currently precludes the level of monitoring that would be necessary to completely monitor cyber communications. So despite the will to exert sovereign authority over cyber space most States are not currently able to completely prevent react to or even detect cyber attacks on or emanating from the cyber infrastructure within their territorial borders. In particular States are generally slow in deterring and prosecuting cyber attackers targeting private companies. In light of the ineffective action of many States in securing cyber space private actors whether multinational information corporations or private cyber security companies hired by other companies have reacted to harmful cyber operations themselves. Cyber defence activities may stay in the network of the defender. Alternatively they may intrude into the network of the cyber attacker and are then known as “hack-back” activities. International law does not recognise the right of hacking-back by private entities and in principle does not prohibit it. Hacking-back by non-State actors is however currently contrary to national legal systems and as such contrary to the content of the rule of law at municipal levels.

This new book totally departs from traditional introductions to international law describing the content and functioning of that law. The book explains that current international law is the product of an evolution that began at the beginning of the eighteenth century and that was influenced by the political sociological and cultural context. This historical-contextual approach gives a realistic and critical vision of international law. Thus the author departs from the traditional positivist point of view that dominates French speaking academia. She also makes a valuable contribution to other introductions to international law by English-speaking academia that when it studies international law in context usually only examines how international law is influenced by international politics.

Le Comité interprète de manière assez prudente la base du droit à un procès équitable. Il requiert en revanche une mise en oeuvre plus rigoureuse des garanties spécifiques au droit à un procès équitable en matière pénale dans les procès où la peine capitale est encourue que dans d’autres procès où la peine encourue est moins grave. En outre suite à une interprétation englobante du paragraphe 2 de l’article 6 du Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques le Comité des droits de l’homme intègre le droit au procès équitable dans le droit à la vie. Il constate dès lors que la violation de la règle du procès équitable constitue aussi en soi une violation du droit à la vie si une sentence de mort a été prononcée. Or le droit à la vie faisant partie des droits intangibles le droit à un procès équitable devient lui-même indérogeable quand l’individu est passible de la peine capitale.,General Public International Law/The law of International Peace and Security/International Cyber Security Law/International H,77,Senior Lecturer University of Aberdeen School of Law (UK),-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=vNvRYksAAAAJ&hl=en

En 1945 les Etats-Unis l’Union des Républiques socialistes soviétiques le Royaume-Uni et la France instaurent une occupation quadripartite en Allemagne. La mésentente entre les Alliés occidentaux et l’Union soviétique aboutit en 1949 à l’établissement de deux Républiques sur le territoire de l’Etat allemand: la République fédérale d’Allemagne et la République démocratique allemande. Les Quatre grands conservent des droits d’occupation sur l’Etat allemand dans son ensemble c’est-à-dire sur l’Etat allemand englobant le territoire des deux Républiques allemandes. Berlin continue de subir un statut d’occupation particulier. Les pouvoirs réservés d'occupation des quatre vainqueurs sur l’Etat allemand dans son ensemble incluent une compétence de détermination du statut de cet Etat. Les attributions réservées des occupants limitent également la plénitude des compétences étatiques de la RFA Et de la RDA lesquelles sont pourtant reconnues comme Etats. La situation d’exception constituée par l’incertitude du statut de l’Etat allemand se termine avec l’effondrement du bloc communiste. Seuls quelques mois suffisent pour organiser la disparition de la RDA Et le rétablissement en 1991 d’une Allemagne souveraine identique à la RFA Cette thèse tente de synthétiser l’ensemble des enseignements que peut apporter à la théorie de l’Etat en droit international l’évolution de la condition internationale de l’Allemagne à partir de 1945.,General Public International Law/The law of International Peace and Security/International Cyber Security Law/International H,77,Senior Lecturer University of Aberdeen School of Law (UK),-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=vNvRYksAAAAJ&hl=en

Militants of IS now control wide portions of territory in Iraq and Syria as well as an area in Libya. IS has killed and injured thousands of people and IS-related violence has led to the displacement of over a million people.

Patricia Živković,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wIFFAosAAAAJ&hl=en,The Impact of Florida Statute 800.03 on Local Regulation of Nude Dancing Facilities,Local governments throughout the country have enacted adult entertainment codes regulating among other things massage parlors adult movie theaters adult video stores and adult toy stores. Local governments have not forgotten live performances particularly nude or topless dancing. Regulations throughout the country require facilities to get licenses before they operate; require that the dancers get licenses; regulate the location of these facilities; and regulate their interiors. These regulations are often challenged with the challenge being based on the First Amendment. The assumption behind all these cases is that the First Amendment protects nude dancing. That assumption is now unassailable but perhaps irrelevant. In 1991 in Barnes v. Glen Theatre eight justices unequivocally stated that the First Amendment protects nude dancing. At the same time the Court (with five members concurring in the result) in Barnes held that a statute that prohibited all public nudity could be constitutionally prohibited. These positions were reinforced in 2000 in City of Erie v. Pap's AM In City of Erie seven members of the Court agreed that the First Amendment protects nude dancing. Different justices agreed that a ban on public nudity could be constitutionally applied to nude dancing. More importantly six of the seven agreed (in two separate opinions) that a general public nudity ban is always constitutional even if applied to nude dancing. This paper is based on the assumption that a public nudity ban is constitutional as applied to nude dancing.,Commercial Arbitration/Negotiation/Biometrics/Data Protection/Private International Law,31,Lecturer in International Dispute Resolution,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=wIFFAosAAAAJ&hl=en

Such adverse costs decisions are supposed to be incentives for parties and counsels to act more diligently and efficiently. However there are certain limits to this approach stemming from the lack of predictability the applicable cost allocation standard and the party against which these sanctions are rendered.

The full variety of its implications on international commercial arbitration is yet to be seen. For that reason national courts arbitral tribunals and doctrine are widely dealing with its repercussions on arbitration proceedings. In order to contribute to this wide discussion this paper focuses on one particular aspect within the arbitration proceedings influenced by a third party funding: responsibility for payment of adverse costs in cases involving impecunious claimants. The problem presented in this paper is whether in case where the claimant cannot cover the costs the third party funder should be responsible for the successful adverse party's costs and on which legal basis? The two parts of the paper analyze the possibilities for such funder's responsibility at two stages of the proceedings:(1) at the …,Commercial Arbitration/Negotiation/Biometrics/Data Protection/Private International Law,31,Lecturer in International Dispute Resolution,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=wIFFAosAAAAJ&hl=en

Patricia Živković,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wIFFAosAAAAJ&hl=en,Impecunious Parties in Arbitration: An Overview of European National Courts’ Practice,Arbitration is a privately funded dispute resolution mechanism. When concluding the arbitration agreement the parties usually agree to pay the advance on costs which is calculated in accordance with a predictable cost schedule for the calculation of the arbitrator’s fees and administrative charges and at the same time they are expected to fund their attorney’s fees. Since without the payment of the advance or the sufficient funds for legal representation the parties’ claims will not be heard at all or the principle on the equality of the parties may be disturbed the financial incapacity of either of the parties may severely jeopardize their due process rights. This paper analyses the aftermath of the impecuniosity of the parties in arbitration depending on the procedural position of an impecunious party in an arbitral proceeding. The analysis is based on the comparison of national courts’ practice in Germany Austria Hungary England and Wales France and Portugal.,Commercial Arbitration/Negotiation/Biometrics/Data Protection/Private International Law,31,Lecturer in International Dispute Resolution,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=wIFFAosAAAAJ&hl=en

The topic is narrowed down to situations in which the parties to arbitration agreement become impecunious and cannot afford the costs of arbitration proceedings. The suspension or termination of these proceedings which follows when parties do not pay the required advance on costs leaves the parties without the forum before which they can vindicate their rights. Moreover in case of impecunious respondents who participate in arbitration without necessary funds the right to be heard can be violated. Since arbitration agreements are considered to be a waiver of the right of access to court under Article 6 (1) the question is whether subsequent financial incapacity of either of the parties can and should lift such a waiver. The paper analyses both the jurisprudence of the European Court for Human Rights and of the national courts dealing with this matter.,Commercial Arbitration/Negotiation/Biometrics/Data Protection/Private International Law,31,Lecturer in International Dispute Resolution,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=wIFFAosAAAAJ&hl=en

Patricia Živković,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wIFFAosAAAAJ&hl=en,Overriding Mandatory Rules in International Commercial Arbitration,Public policy and its reflection in overriding mandatory rules has been a long-discussed hurdle in the international arbitration community and it still represents a puzzle for even experienced arbitrators and academics. This book leads the reader through five chapters of a well-thoughtout perspective on the application of overriding mandatory rules in international commercial arbitration.The definition of overriding mandatory rules has long been discussed back-to-back with the notion of public policy. It is not an easy job to offer a solid definition of either of these terms; however the author's attempted definition in chapter one is concise and supported by a thorough overview of legal sources and authorities. The leitmotiv of the pursuit of the definition of overriding mandatory rules is that the definition of these rules is underpinned by the notion of public policy even though the mandatory rules have over time emerged …,Commercial Arbitration/Negotiation/Biometrics/Data Protection/Private International Law,31,Lecturer in International Dispute Resolution,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=wIFFAosAAAAJ&hl=en

The follow-up discussion focused on the question of whether the arbitrator had the power to do so in the first place and the funder's uplift properly characterized as costs under applicable rules. This article follows this discussion and embeds it within international arbitration theory and practice to determine whether there are any novelties that are brought to the table by Essar in Norscot decisions when it comes to recoverability of outcome-based fees in international arbitration.,Commercial Arbitration/Negotiation/Biometrics/Data Protection/Private International Law,31,Lecturer in International Dispute Resolution,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=wIFFAosAAAAJ&hl=en
Patricia Živković,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wIFFAosAAAAJ&hl=en,Bankruptcy and International Arbitration: Some Comparative Snapshots,The article contains the comparative snapshots of national laws and courts’ decisions which deal with the effects of bankruptcy on international arbitration. These effects are severe and they may affect the arbitrability of a dispute the conduct of arbitration or the validity of an arbitration agreement. They stem from the conflict of the underlying policies of the two procedures: bankruptcy and arbitration. While arbitration is based on the principle of parties’ autonomy and privity and it supposes the decentralization of the forum bankruptcy proceedings are judicial collective and centralized. This conflict is usually left to be resolved at the national level which results in the lack of uniformity of solutions at the international level and consequently there is no predictability for the parties involved in international arbitration. The author provided an overview and a critical analysis of the determination of the law applicable to the effects of bankruptcy on arbitration and the comparative analysis of several specific effects.,Commercial Arbitration/Negotiation/Biometrics/Data Protection/Private International Law,31,Lecturer in International Dispute Resolution,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=wIFFAosAAAAJ&hl=en
Patricia Živković,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wIFFAosAAAAJ&hl=en,If They Finance Your Claim Will They Pay Me If I Win: Implications of Third Party Funding on Adverse Costs Awards in International Arbitration,Third party funding is a new industry which provides financial support to parties in litigation and arbitration proceedings. The full variety of its implications on international commercial arbitration is yet to be seen. For that reason national courts arbitral tribunals and doctrine are widely dealing with its repercussions on arbitration proceedings. In order to contribute to this wide discussion this paper focuses on one particular aspect within the arbitration proceedings influenced by a third party funding: responsibility for payment of adverse costs in cases involving impecunious claimants. The problem presented in this paper is whether in case where the claimant cannot cover the costs the third party funder should be responsible for the successful adverse party’s costs and on which legal basis? The two parts of the paper analyze the possibilities for such funder’s responsibility at two stages of the proceedings:(1) at the stage of a final award and (2) during the proceedings when the security for costs may be sought. The analysis encompasses the court practice and national arbitration laws from several jurisdictions (the United States the United Kingdom and Germany) the arbitration rules of two leading arbitration institutions (ICC Rules LCIA Rules) as well as arbitral practice in order to predict possible issues and illustrate available solutions.,Commercial Arbitration/Negotiation/Biometrics/Data Protection/Private International Law,31,Lecturer in International Dispute Resolution,-1,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=wIFFAosAAAAJ&hl=en
