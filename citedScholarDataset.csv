Srinivas Aluru,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YOGOScoAAAAJ,A review of hardware acceleration for computational genomics,Hardware accelerators are becoming increasingly commonplace in delivering high performance computing solutions at a fraction of the cost of conventional supercomputers and standalone CPU clusters  despite the additional programming effort required to utilize them  This paper provides a survey on the use of hardware accelerators such as FPGAs and GPUs in the area of biological sequence analysis  particularly in the domain of computational genomics  We also survey research on hardware acceleration in response to emerging trends in high throughput sequencing  and applications enabled by it  We conclude the survey with remarks on how these trends influence the use of hardware acceleration in bioinformatics  and the role of recently developed or soon to be released accelerator technologies ,Data Science/High performance Computing/Computational Biology/Combinatorial Scientific Computing,11082,Professor and Executive Director of Institute for Data Engineering and Science/ Georgia Tech,-1,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=YOGOScoAAAAJ

Srinivas Aluru,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YOGOScoAAAAJ,Parallel information theory based construction of genome wide gene regulatory networks,Constructing genome wide gene regulatory networks from large scale gene expression data is an important problem in systems biology  While several techniques have been developed  none of them is parallel  and they do not scale to the whole
