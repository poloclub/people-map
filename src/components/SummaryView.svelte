  <h1 class="text is-size-1"> What is PeopleMap? </h1>
  <p class="text is-size-5"> PeopleMap is a data visualization tool that uses natural language processing (NLP) to map out researchers through graphical representations, using a variety of textual characteristics related to each researcher, such as college/school of their professorship, laboratory affiliation, titles and abstracts of their papers found on Google Scholar, and Google Scholar keywords.
  </p>
  <p class="text is-size-5"> By analyzing this information through a variety of NLP techniques, such as NMF and TFIDF, we can get a better understanding of the topics and focuses related to the variety of academic researchers at Georgia Tech. These connections and groups can, in turn, be visualized through a graphical system of nodes and edges that builds a more intuitive image of the researchers, which helps external groups, as well as individuals at Georgia Tech, understand our vast academic diversity better.
