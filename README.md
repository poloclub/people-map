PeopleMap is the first interactive, open-source, web-based tool that visually “maps out” researchers based on their research interests and publications by leveraging embeddings generated by natural language processing (NLP) techniques. To generate a PeopleMap, you only need to provide the researchers’ Google Scholar profile URLs.

Discovering research expertise at institutions can be a difficult task. Manually curated university directories easily become out of date and often lack the information necessary to understand a researcher’s interests and past work, making it harder to explore the diversity of research at an institution and pinpoint potential collaborators. PeopleMap solves these problems!
