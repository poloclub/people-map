# PeopleMap

A visualization tool that visually “maps out” researchers based on their research interests and publications, based on embeddings generated by natural language processing (NLP) techniques

Discovering research expertise at institutions can be a difficult task. Manually curated university directories easily become out of date and often lack the information necessary to understand a researcher’s interests and past work, making it harder to explore the diversity of research at an institution and pinpoint potential collaborators. PeopleMap solves these problems! To generate a PeopleMap, you only need to provide the researchers’ Google Scholar profile URLs.
