John G. Carlson,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0Vp-gvoAAAAJ,Designing price contracts for procurement and marketing of industrial equipment,A durable goods contract typically specifies a price determination process  which is an integral part of  rules of the game  that govern the exchange between the contracting parties  Drawing on principles of new institutional economics  these contractual price processes are arrayed on a flexibility continuum ranging from predetermination through redetermination to renegotiation  A well designed contract specifies a price process that is aligned in a discriminating fashion with the two fundamental problems of efficient exchange adapting to changed circumstances  while simultaneously safeguarding against opportunism  A simple but effective price design rule is as follows  Greater adaptation needs call for moving away from predetermination processes toward renegotiation processes  while increased opportunism hazards call for moving in the opposite direction  The proper balance is illustrated with two cases  ,Marketing Channels/Marketing Strategy/Business to Business Marketing,18098,Professor of Marketing  Carlson School of Management  University of Minnesota,2017,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=0Vp-gvoAAAAJ

John G. Carlson,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0Vp-gvoAAAAJ,Is Cash King  A Field Experiment on Mental Accounting in a Salesforce,The fungibility of money  along with its function as a medium of exchange  gives monetary transactions pride of place in neoclassical theories of economics  However  a growing number of laboratory studies and anecdotal field evidence  appealing to theories of mental accounting  have shown that consumers  willingness to spend an additional unit of wealth depends upon the sources and categories of wealth  thus throwing serious doubt on the presumed fungibility of cash  This paper attempts to examine the notion of money fungibility in the context of salesperson effort  Given that firms desire to design the least cost pay basket to evoke a given level of effort  it is important to i  identify whether salespersons differ in their response to disparate forms of compensation  ii  quantify the impact of different sources of wealth  and iii  explore the underlying mechanisms at play  We seek to achieve the above objectives using a multi method empirical approach  In particular  we use a field intervention  reduced form estimation to derive initial insights from the intervention  a structural model to uncover the differential response to cash versus non cash compensation  We also implement a survey of our salespeople to pinpoint the precursors of separate budgets  We find converging evidence that salespeople maintain separate accounts for cash and non cash bonuses  dispelling the neo classical expectation that favors cash as king ,Marketing Channels/Marketing Strategy/Business to Business Marketing,18098,Professor of Marketing  Carlson School of Management  University of Minnesota,2013,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=0Vp-gvoAAAAJ

John G. Carlson,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0Vp-gvoAAAAJ,Economic impact of category captaincy  an examination of assortments and prices ,Vertical arrangements like  Category Captaincy  and  Slotting fees  involve transactions on both price and non price aspects  such as shelf space allocations and assortments  and are becoming increasingly popular in retail markets  Given the financial scope and magnitude of the retail sector  such arrangements can have a disproportionately large impact on consumers and on the competitive landscape  Not surprisingly  they have been the subject of much scrutiny from industry practitioners and public policy experts  However  empirical work concerning these practices have been hampered by i  the difficulty in obtaining detailed data on these arrangements  and ii  the difficulty in developing models that can examine both price and non price aspects of these arrangements  while accounting for horizontal competition between manufacturers and vertical interactions between manufacturers and retailers  In this paper  I attempt to address the challenges above in the context of Category Captaincy  an arrangement where the retailer works exclusively with a manufacturer to manage both the manufacturer s and his rivals  products  and its impact on assortments and prices  I develop an empirical model of demand and supply to model assortment decisions under various category captain arrangements  I use a unique dataset for the frozen pizza category  that contains information on category captaincy across    retail chains and   local markets in the United States  in addition to retail movement data  I discuss three potential welfare effects that occur under category captaincy  An efficiency effect occurs if captaincy lowers upfront cost per SKU compared  ,Marketing Channels/Marketing Strategy/Business to Business Marketing,18098,Professor of Marketing  Carlson School of Management  University of Minnesota,2012,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=0Vp-gvoAAAAJ

Anders Sandberg,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aefVOM4AAAAJ,Dissolving the Fermi paradox,The Fermi paradox is the conflict between an expectation of a high   em ex ante  probability of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe and the apparently lifeless universe we in fact observe  The expectation that the universe should be teeming with intelligent life is linked to models like the Drake equation  which suggest that even if the probability of intelligent life developing at a given site is small  the sheer multitude of possible sites should nonetheless yield a large number of potentially observable civilizations  We show that this conflict arises from the use of Drake like equations  which implicitly assume certainty regarding highly uncertain parameters  We examine these parameters  incorporating models of chemical and genetic transitions on paths to the origin of life  and show that extant scientific knowledge corresponds to uncertainties that span multiple orders of magnitude  This makes a stark difference  When the model is recast to represent realistic distributions of uncertainty  we find a substantial   em ex ante  probability of there being no other intelligent life in our observable universe  and thus that there should be little surprise when we fail to detect any signs of it  This result dissolves the Fermi paradox  and in doing so removes any need to invoke speculative mechanisms by which civilizations would inevitably fail to have observable effects upon the universe ,Human enhancement/Existential risk/Brain emulation/Emerging technologies/SETI,3802,Senior Research Fellow  Future of Humanity Institute  Oxford University,2018,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=aefVOM4AAAAJ

Trevor Darrell,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bh-uRFMAAAAJ,Weakly Supervised Action Localization with Expectation Maximization Multi Instance Learning,Weakly supervised action localization problem requires training a model to localize the action segments in the video given only video level action label  It can be solved under the Multiple Instance Learning  MIL  framework  where a bag  video  contains multiple instances  action segments   Since only the bag s label is known  the main challenge is to assign which key instances within the bag trigger the bag s label  Most previous models use an attention based approach  These models use attention to generate the bag s representation from instances and then train it via bag s classification  In this work  we explicitly model the key instances assignment as a hidden variable and adopt an Expectation Maximization framework  We derive two pseudo label generation schemes to model the E and M process and iteratively optimize the likelihood lower bound  We also show that previous attention based models implicitly violate the MIL assumptions that instances in negative bags should be uniformly negative  In comparison  Our EM MIL approach more accurately models these assumptions  Our model achieves state of the art performance on two standard benchmarks  THUMOS   and ActivityNet      and shows the superiority of detecting relative complete action boundary in videos containing multiple actions ,Computer Vision/Artificial Intelligence,111688,Professor of Computer Science  U C  Berkeley,2020,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=bh-uRFMAAAAJ
