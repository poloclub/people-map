John G. Carlson,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0Vp-gvoAAAAJ,Forward integration into distribution  an empirical test of transaction cost analysis,The issue of forward vertical integration has attracted a good deal of attention from researchers in several disciplines  including economics  marketing  and law  Many explanations have been offered for this phenomenon  including technological interrelationships involving economies of scale and scope  Chandler   uncertainty and risk considerations  Arrow         information externalities  Green   and strategic purposes  Blair and Kaserman        offer an extensive survey of the extant literature in this area  Of particular note  however  is the recent rise in prominence of the transaction costs analysis  tca  of vertical integration  This approach consists of a blend of institutional economics  organizational theory  and contract law  and has been developed primarily by Oliver Williamson               He views vertical integration as a response to the inability of arms length market relationships to govern exchange  ,Marketing Channels/Marketing Strategy/Business to Business Marketing,18098,Professor of Marketing  Carlson School of Management  University of Minnesota,-1,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=0Vp-gvoAAAAJ

John G. Carlson,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0Vp-gvoAAAAJ,When does vertical coordination improve industrial purchasing relationships ,Vertically coordinated ties are purportedly effective responses to the uncertainties of fast changing purchasing environments  Building on transaction costs arguments and related work in marketing  the authors analyze vertical coordination as a response to external uncertainty and show that its effectiveness is highly contingent on the magnitude of the safeguarding problem present  Indeed  its beneficial effects can be overwhelmed by the consequential increase in trading hazards  The authors use survey data from a sample of     industrial buyers to test the hypotheses  When specific investments are modest  greater vertical coordination diminishes transaction difficulties in adapting to high environmental uncertainty  Conversely  vertical coordination increases transaction difficulties when firms adapt to high environmental uncertainty and specific investments are substantial  The authors discuss the importance of  ,Marketing Channels/Marketing Strategy/Business to Business Marketing,18098,Professor of Marketing  Carlson School of Management  University of Minnesota,-1,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=0Vp-gvoAAAAJ

Anders Sandberg,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aefVOM4AAAAJ,Non pharmacological cognitive enhancement,The term  cognitive enhancement  usually characterizes interventions in humans that aim to improve mental functioning beyond what is necessary to sustain or restore good health  While the current bioethical debate mainly concentrates on pharmaceuticals  according to the given characterization  cognitive enhancement also by non pharmacological means has to be regarded as enhancement proper  Here we summarize empirical data on approaches using nutrition  physical exercise  sleep  meditation  mnemonic strategies  computer training  and brain stimulation for enhancing cognitive capabilities  Several of these non pharmacological enhancement strategies seem to be more efficacious compared to currently available pharmaceuticals usually coined as cognitive enhancers  While many ethical arguments of the cognitive enhancement debate apply to both pharmacological and non pharmacological    div   div ,Human enhancement/Existential risk/Brain emulation/Emerging technologies/SETI,3802,Senior Research Fellow  Future of Humanity Institute  Oxford University,-1,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=aefVOM4AAAAJ
Anders Sandberg,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aefVOM4AAAAJ,Human enhancement,Human beings are a marvel of evolved complexity  Such systems can be difficult to enhance  When we manipulate complex evolved systems  which are poorly understood  our interventions often fail or backfire  It can appear as if there is a   wisdom of nature  which we ignore at our peril  Sometimes the belief in nature s wisdom and corresponding doubts about the prudence of tampering with nature  especially human nature manifest as diffusely moral objections against enhancement  Such objections may be expressed as intuitions about the superiority of the natural or the troublesomeness of hubris  or as an evaluative bias in favor of the status quo  This chapter explores the extent to which such prudence derived anti enhancement sentiments are justified  We develop a heuristic  inspired by the field of evolutionary medicine  for identifying promising human enhancement interventions  The heuristic incorporates the grains of truth contained in   nature knows best  attitudes while providing criteria for the special cases where we have reason to believe that it is feasible for us to improve on nature ,Human enhancement/Existential risk/Brain emulation/Emerging technologies/SETI,3802,Senior Research Fellow  Future of Humanity Institute  Oxford University,-1,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=aefVOM4AAAAJ
Anders Sandberg,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aefVOM4AAAAJ,Well being and enhancement,Many chapters in this volume review current and future possibilities for enhancing human physical ability  cognition  mood  and lifespan  These possibilities raise the ethical question of whether we should enhance normal human capacities in these ways  We are not likely to agree on answers to this question without a clear and shared understanding of the concept of enhancement  The aim of this chapter is to offer such an account of enhancement  We begin by reviewing a number of suggested accounts of enhancement  and point to their shortcomings  We identify two key senses of  enhancement   functional enhancement  the enhancement of some capacity or power  eg vision  intelligence  health  and human enhancement  the enhancement of a human being s life  The latter notion  we suggest  is the notion of enhancement most relevant to ethical debate  We argue that it is best understood in welfarist terms  We  ,Human enhancement/Existential risk/Brain emulation/Emerging technologies/SETI,3802,Senior Research Fellow  Future of Humanity Institute  Oxford University,-1,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=aefVOM4AAAAJ

Anders Sandberg,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aefVOM4AAAAJ,Human engineering and climate change,Anthropogenic climate change is arguably one of the biggest problems that confront us today  There is ample evidence that climate change is likely to affect adversely many aspects of life for all people around the world  and that existing solutions such as geoengineering might be too risky and ordinary behavioural and market solutions might not be sufficient to mitigate climate change  In this paper  we consider a new kind of solution to climate change  what we call human engineering  which involves biomedical modifications of humans so that they can mitigate and or adapt to climate change  We argue that human engineering is potentially less risky than geoengineering and that it could help behavioural and market solutions succeed in mitigating climate change  We also consider some possible ethical concerns regarding human engineering such as its safety  the implications of human engineering for our children  ,Human enhancement/Existential risk/Brain emulation/Emerging technologies/SETI,3802,Senior Research Fellow  Future of Humanity Institute  Oxford University,-1,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=aefVOM4AAAAJ

Zhaowen Wang,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lwlYARMAAAAJ,Image captioning with semantic attention,Automatically generating a natural language description of an image has attracted interests recently both because of its importance in practical applications and because it connects two major artificial intelligence fields  computer vision and natural language processing  Existing approaches are either top down  which start from a gist of an image and convert it into words  or bottom up  which come up with words describing various aspects of an image and then combine them  In this paper  we propose a new algorithm that combines both approaches through a model of semantic attention  Our algorithm learns to selectively attend to semantic concept proposals and fuse them into hidden states and outputs of recurrent neural networks  The selection and fusion form a feedback connecting the top down and bottom up computation  We evaluate our algorithm on two public benchmarks  Microsoft COCO and Flickr  K  Experimental results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the state of the art approaches consistently across different evaluation metrics ,Pattern Recognition/Computer Vision/Machine Learning,4206,Adobe Research,-1,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=lwlYARMAAAAJ
Zhaowen Wang,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lwlYARMAAAAJ,Coupled dictionary training for image super resolution,In this paper  we propose a novel coupled dictionary training method for single image super resolution  SR  based on patchwise sparse recovery  where the learned couple dictionaries relate the low  and high resolution  HR  image patch spaces via sparse representation  The learning process enforces that the sparse representation of a low resolution  LR  image patch in terms of the LR dictionary can well reconstruct its underlying HR image patch with the dictionary in the high resolution image patch space  We model the learning problem as a bilevel optimization problem  where the optimization includes an    sup    sup   norm minimization problem in its constraints

Zhaowen Wang,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lwlYARMAAAAJ,Deep networks for image super resolution with sparse prior,Deep learning techniques have been successfully applied in many areas of computer vision  including low level image restoration problems  For image super resolution  several models based on deep neural networks have been recently proposed and attained superior performance that overshadows all previous handcrafted models  The question then arises whether large capacity and data driven models have become the dominant solution to the ill posed super resolution problem  In this paper  we argue that domain expertise represented by the conventional sparse coding model is still valuable  and it can be combined with the key ingredients of deep learning to achieve further improved results  We show that a sparse coding model particularly designed for super resolution can be incarnated as a neural network  and trained in a cascaded structure from end to end  The interpretation of the network based on sparse coding leads to much more efficient and effective training  as well as a reduced model size  Our model is evaluated on a wide range of images  and shows clear advantage over existing state of the art methods in terms of both restoration accuracy and human subjective quality ,Pattern Recognition/Computer Vision/Machine Learning,4206,Adobe Research,-1,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=lwlYARMAAAAJ

Zhaowen Wang,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lwlYARMAAAAJ,Diversified texture synthesis with feed forward networks,Recent progresses on deep discriminative and generative modeling have shown promising results on texture synthesis  However  existing feed forward based methods trade off generality for efficiency  which suffer from many issues  such as shortage of generality  ie  build one network per texture   lack of diversity  ie  always produce visually identical output  and suboptimality  ie  generate less satisfying visual effects   In this work  we focus on solving these issues for improved texture synthesis  We propose a deep generative feed forward network which enables efficient synthesis of multiple textures within one single network and meaningful interpolation between them  Meanwhile  a suite of important techniques are introduced to achieve better convergence and diversity  With extensive experiments  we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and techniques for synthesizing a large number of textures and show its applications with the stylization ,Pattern Recognition/Computer Vision/Machine Learning,4206,Adobe Research,-1,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=lwlYARMAAAAJ
Zhaowen Wang,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lwlYARMAAAAJ,Robust video super resolution with learned temporal dynamics,Video super resolution  SR  aims to generate a high resolution  HR  frame from multiple low resolution  LR  frames  The inter frame temporal relation is as crucial as the intra frame spatial relation for tackling this problem  However  how to utilize temporal information efficiently and effectively remains challenging since complex motion is difficult to model and can introduce adverse effects if not handled properly  We address this problem from two aspects  First  we propose a temporal adaptive neural network that can adaptively determine the optimal scale of temporal dependency  Filters on various temporal scales are applied to the input LR sequence before their responses are adaptively aggregated  Second  we reduce the complexity of motion between neighboring frames using a spatial alignment network that is much more robust and efficient than competing alignment methods and can be jointly trained with the temporal adaptive network in an end to end manner  Our proposed models with learned temporal dynamics are systematically evaluated on public video datasets and achieve state of the art SR results compared with other recent video SR approaches  Both of the temporal adaptation and the spatial alignment modules are demonstrated to considerably improve SR quality over their plain counterparts ,Pattern Recognition/Computer Vision/Machine Learning,4206,Adobe Research,-1,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=lwlYARMAAAAJ
